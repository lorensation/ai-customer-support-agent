## Billing Cycle & Payment

### How Billing Works

**Monthly Billing:**
- Billed on the same day each month
- Based on number of active users
- Prorated for mid-cycle changes
- Automatic renewal

**Annual Billing:**
- Save 20% compared to monthly
- Billed once per year
- Non-refundable
- Better for stable team sizes

### Payment Methods

**Accepted:**
- Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover
- PayPal
- Bank transfer (Enterprise plans only, annual billing)
- Purchase orders (Enterprise only)

**Currency:** USD (other currencies converted at current exchange rate)

**Tax:** Sales tax or VAT applied based on your location

### Billing Examples

**Scenario 1:** Professional plan, 10 users, monthly billing
- Cost: $29 × 10 = $290/month

**Scenario 2:** Professional plan, 10 users, annual billing
- Monthly equivalent: $29 × 10 = $290
- Annual cost: $290 × 12 × 0.8 = $2,784/year
- **You save: $696/year**

**Scenario 3:** Professional plan, add 3 users mid-cycle (15th of month)
- Original: 10 users × $29 = $290
- Added: 3 users × $29 × 0.5 (prorated) = $43.50
- Next invoice: $333.50 (then $377 ongoing)
